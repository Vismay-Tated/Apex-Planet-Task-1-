    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hi! My name is Vismay Tated, and I am currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I enjoy learning about how smart systems work and how we can use data to solve real-life problems.
        <br>
        <br>
        A long with my studies, I have also learned full-stack web development using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). It has helped me understand how websites and web apps work, both on the front end and back end.
        <br>
        <br>
        I love learning new things and building projects that are useful and creative. I am especially interested in combining AI and web development to make cool and smart applications.
